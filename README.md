# 🧠 CI/CD Pipeline Practice Project

This project was created as a **hands-on practice** to understand how **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** works using **GitHub Actions**.  
It’s a simple **Node.js web app** that automatically **builds**, **tests**, and **deploys** whenever I push new changes to GitHub.

## 🎯 Objective

To **learn and implement** the fundamentals of DevOps automation by:
- Setting up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions  
- Practicing how to run automated builds and tests  
- Understanding deployment automation workflows  
- Gaining hands-on experience in version control and GitHub integration

## 🧩 Project Overview

This is a **basic web application** with a front-end (HTML/CSS) and a back-end built in **Node.js (Express.js)**.  
The pipeline runs automatically every time I push changes — simulating a real-world CI/CD environment.
