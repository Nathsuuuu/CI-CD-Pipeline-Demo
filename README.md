# CI-CD-Pipeline-Demo
This demo sets up a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment of a sample Node.js web application. The pipeline will run on every push to the main branch, building the app, running tests, and deploying it to GitHub Pages for easy hosting.
